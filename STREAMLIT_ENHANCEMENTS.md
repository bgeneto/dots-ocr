## New Feature: Header/Footer Control

### Overview
A new sidebar option allows users to control whether page headers and footers are included in the final combined markdown file when processing PDF documents.

### Configuration
- **Location**: Sidebar under "Output Configuration"
- **Default**: Unchecked (headers and footers excluded)
- **Label**: "Include Page Headers & Footers in Markdown"
- **Help Text**: Explains the behavior difference between checked and unchecked states

### Behavior
- **When Unchecked (Default)**:
  - Uses `*_page_X_nohf.md` files for content
  - Downloads as `combined_document_{session_id}_nohf.md`
  - Button label: "ðŸ“„ Download Combined Markdown (No Headers/Footers)"
  - Provides cleaner content suitable for metrics and benchmarks

- **When Checked**:
  - Uses `*_page_X.md` files for content
  - Downloads as `combined_document_{session_id}.md`
  - Button label: "ðŸ“„ Download Combined Markdown"
  - Includes complete document structure with headers and footers

### Technical Implementation
- Modifies `create_combined_markdown_file()` to accept `include_headers_footers` parameter
- Intelligently selects between `md_content_path` and `md_content_nohf_path` from DotsOCRParser results
- Updates filename and button labels dynamically based on user preference
- Fallback mechanism: if nohf version unavailable, uses regular version
